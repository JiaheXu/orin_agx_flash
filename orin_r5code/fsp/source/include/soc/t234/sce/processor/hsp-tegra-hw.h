 * Compile-time check for FSP header files

 *   FSP project.  The CT_ASSERT macro (contained in misc/ct-assert.h) can
 *   check for this signature.  If it does not exist, then the build will
 *   abort.

 *   This is a trap for projects which have their own include files of the
 *   same names, but different contents.  This trap ensures that only the
 *   files from the FSP project, are built into the FSP source code.
